            If you are an Iowa girl with special needs, you can be part of the
            Dreams Made True, Inc. Pageant. Registration is preferred by {registrationDate.format('MMMM Do, YYYY')}, along with the $50.00 registration fee. This fee covers all
            pageant events, meals, a t-shirt for the contestant, and two adult
            tickets to the main event. Registrations received after {registrationDate.format('MMMM Do')} are
            not guaranteed a t-shirt or recognition in the program.
